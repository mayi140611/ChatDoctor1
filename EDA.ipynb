If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection.

For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief.',\n",

You can take anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen for symptomatic relief.4) Doing cool compresses over the scrotal area will help in reducing the inflammation and pain.'}"

By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time?

In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. '}"
